# COVID19Japan.com

A community powered COVID-19 coronavirus tracker for Japan.

The project is a single page JavaScript application running in the browser, pulling data in via a JSON file, and hosted on GitHub Pages.


## Data Sources

Our data is sourced from a variety of sources, primarily Japanese news outlets like NHK, prefectural governments, and the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare.

### Localization

All strings in the `src/` files should be localized like this:

1. Add a key-value pair in `src/i18n/en.json` for your string/text
2. For HTML: add the `data-i18n="your-new-key"` attribute to the HTML element to be localized (replace "your-new-key" in the example)
3. For JavaScript: call the `i18next.t("your-new-key")` function to retrieve the localized string (replace "your-new-key" in the example)
4. Add any additional translations with the same key to other files in `src/i18n/`
